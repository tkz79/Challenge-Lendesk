# TASK DESCRIPTION

Using Ruby, create a command line application that recursively reads all of the
images from the supplied directory of images, extracts their EXIF GPS data
(longitude and latitude), and then writes the name of that image and any GPS
co-ordinates it finds to a CSV file.

This utility should be executable from the command line (i.e.: ‘ruby ./app.rb’
or as an executable).

With no parameters, the utility should default to scanning from the current
directory. It should take an optional parameter that allows any other directory
to be passed in.

As a bonus, output either CSV or HTML, based on a parameter passed in via the
command line.

Feel free to use any gem(s) you like in your submission.
